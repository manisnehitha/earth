<font size="4">
<p>Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean.</p>
</font>

<font size="4">
<p>The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them.</p>
</font>

<font size="4">
<p>It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity.</p>
</font>

<font size="4">
<p>The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line.</p>
</font>

<font size="4">
<p>A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa
and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas, separating it from Europe

<p>The Arctic region is a unique area among Earth's ecosystems.</p>
</font>

<font size="4">
<p>The cultures in the region and the Arctic indigenous peoples have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions.</p>
<font>

<font size="4">
<p>Life in the Arctic includes zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants and human societies.</p>
</font>

<font size="4">
<p>Arctic land is bordered by the subarctic.</p>
</font>

<font size="4">
<p>The word Arctic comes from the Greek word arktikos, "near the Bear, northern" and from the word (arktos), meaning bear.</p>
</font>

<font size="4">
<p>The name refers either to the constellation Ursa Major, the "Great Bear", which is prominent in the northern portion of the celestial sphere,</p>
</font>


<font size="4">
<p>or, the "Little Bear", which contains the celestial north pole (currently very near Polaris, the current north Pole Star, or North Star) or to the constellation Ursa Min</p>

<p>Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, 
when the worldwide median age was 30.4. Despite a wide range of natural resources.

<h4><b><u><i>AMERICAS</b></u><i></h4>

<font size="4">
<p>The topography is dominated by the American Cordillera, a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast.</p>

<font size="4">
<p>The flatter eastern side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins, such as the Amazon,</p>
</font>

<font size="4">
<p>St. Lawrence River–Great Lakes basin, Mississippi, and La Plata. Since the Americas extend 14,000 km from north to south,</p>
<font>

<font size="4">
<p>the climate and ecology vary widely, from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada,</p>
